In 2019 I passed the AWS Developer certification exam. The exam questions from [this Practice Exam](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=973927&u=2310472&m=43514&urllink=&afftrack=) helped me a lot.

The exam offers the following advantages:

* 12 Full-length Mock Exams (745 unique questions) 
* Questions updated based on 2019 exam.
* Section Tests - 5 objective / topic-wise quiz for CDA latest exam version (40 unique questions)
* 44 labs for the AWS Certified Developer Associate Exam
* Free Access to Labs
* Objective-Based Practice Tests.
* An Exhaustive Explanation for every question
* Reports to assess strengths & weaknesses
* Unlimited Access

The over 700 questions cover every area of ​​the test. I still recommend taking an online course on this subject.
